    "faq_question_1": "What are custom fields in Blue?",
    "faq_answer_1": "Custom fields allow you to build data structures that map exactly to your business needs — all without writing any code. With 23 different field types, you can capture any information your organization requires, from simple text to complex calculations and relationships between records.",
    
    "faq_question_2": "How many custom fields can I add?",
    "faq_answer_2": "There are no hard limits on the number of custom fields you can add to your projects. While you can have several hundred fields, performance may gradually decrease as the number grows. Most organizations find that 20-50 fields per project covers all their needs effectively.",
    
    "faq_question_3": "Which field types are unique to Blue?",
    "faq_answer_3": "Blue offers several unique field types that set us apart: the Button field lets you trigger automations with a single click, and the Time in List field automatically tracks how long records spend in each stage of your process. These fields enable powerful workflows that aren't possible in other tools.",
    
    "faq_question_4": "Can I change field types after creating them?",
    "faq_answer_4": "To maintain data integrity, field types cannot be changed after creation. However, you can create a new field with the desired type and use automations or bulk editing to migrate your data. This approach ensures your existing data remains safe while you transition to the new field structure.",
    
    "faq_question_5": "How do custom fields work with other Blue features?",
    "faq_answer_5": "Custom fields integrate seamlessly with all Blue features. They can trigger automations, appear in forms, display in dashboards, and be accessed via our API. Different field types work particularly well together — like using Reference fields with Lookups, or Formula fields with Numbers and Currency.",
    
    "faq_question_6": "Can I use formulas with custom fields?",
    "faq_answer_6": "Yes! Formula fields can perform calculations using data from other Number, Currency, and Date fields. You can create everything from simple additions to complex business calculations. Formulas update automatically when the underlying data changes, keeping your calculations always current.",
    
    "faq_question_7": "Are custom fields available on all plans?",
    "faq_answer_7": "All Blue plans include custom fields. Every plan gets access to all 23 field types with no restrictions. This ensures that businesses of any size can build the exact data structure they need without artificial limitations.",
