In Blue, a record can have 2 statuses: `INCOMPLETE` and `COMPLETE`.

To toggle the status of a record, you can use the following mutation:

```graphql
mutation ToggleRecordDoneStatus {
  updateTodoDoneStatus(todoId: "ENTER RECORD ID") {
    id
    uid
    position
    title
    text
    html
    startedAt
    duedAt
    timezone
    color
    cover
    done
  }
}

```
