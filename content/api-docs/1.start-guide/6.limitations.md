title: Limitations
description: Known limitations of the Blue API.
---

Here are the current known limitations of the Blue API:

1. **Forms API**: Not recommended for use due to Google authentication requirements.

2. **Per-user API**: API tokens are linked to individual users. For a user-independent token, create a dummy user in Blue specifically for API usage across projects.

3. **Audit log limitations**: 
   - Unable to distinguish between API token and regular user authentication in logs.
   - No audit logs for creation, update, or deletion of authentication tokens.

4. **API format**: REST API is not currently supported.

5. **Rate limiting**: [Add information about rate limits, if applicable]

6. **Data limitations**: [Add any restrictions on data volume, types, etc.]

We are continuously working to improve our API. For the latest updates, please check our [changelog](/platform/changelog) or [contact our support team](mailto:help@blue.cc).
