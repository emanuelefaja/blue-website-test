## Remove User from Project

To remove a user from a project, you can use the following mutation:

```graphql
mutation {
  removeProjectUser(
    input: {
      userId: "ENTER USER ID"
      projectId: "ENTER PROJECT ID (NOT SLUG)"
    }
  ) {
    success
  }
}
```

## Remove user from company
To remove a user from a company, you can make the following mutation:

```graphql
mutation RemoveCompanyUser {
  removeCompanyUser(
    input: {
      companyId: "company-id"
      userId: "user-id"
    }
  )
}
```

Note that this is not reversible. All the data associated with the user is not deleted, it just removes them from the company. They will be unassigned from all records and projects.
