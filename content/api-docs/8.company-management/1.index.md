description: How to create a new company using the Blue API.
---

To create a new company, you can use the following mutation:

```graphql
mutation CreateCompany {
  createCompany(input: { name: "new", slug: "new-slug" }) {
    id
  }
}
```

Note that creating new companies may affect the billing of your Blue account, as each company is billed separately.


Here are the options for the `createCompany` mutation and their descriptions:

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| name | String | The name of the new company. This is a required field. |
| slug | String | A URL-friendly version of the company name. This is used in the company's URL and should be unique. This is a required field and will also act as the unique identifier for the company. |
