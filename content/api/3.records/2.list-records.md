## Records in Company

To get a list of records across a company, you can use the following query. You can optionally pass a start date and due date to filter the records.

```graphql
query ListOfRecordsBetweenAStartAndDueDate {
  todoQueries {
    todos(
      filter: {
        companyIds: ["ENTER COMPANY ID"],
        startedAt: "2024-04-07T17:00:00.000Z"
        dueEnd: "2024-04-10T16:59:59.999Z"
      }
      skip: 0
      limit: 20
      sort: [position_ASC]
    ) {
      items {
        id
        uid
        position
        title
        text
        html
        startedAt
        duedAt
        timezone
        color
        cover
        done
      }
      pageInfo {
        totalPages
        totalItems
        page
        perPage
        hasNextPage
        hasPreviousPage
      }
    }
  }
}
``` 


This table provides a comprehensive overview of the data fields available for each record in the list. You can use these fields to display and organize your records as needed in your application.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| id | Unique identifier for the record |
| uid | User-friendly unique identifier for the record |
| position | Position of the record in the list |
| title | Title of the record |
| text | Plain text content of the record |
| html | HTML formatted content of the record |
| startedAt | Date and time when the record was started |
| duedAt | Due date and time for the record |
| timezone | Timezone associated with the record's dates |
| color | Color assigned to the record for visual organization |
| cover | URL or identifier for the record's cover image |
| done | Boolean indicating whether the record is completed |




Here's a table describing the fields in the `pageInfo` object:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| totalPages | Total number of pages available for the current query |
| totalItems | Total number of items across all pages |
| page | Current page number |
| perPage | Number of items per page |
| hasNextPage | Boolean indicating whether there is a next page |
| hasPreviousPage | Boolean indicating whether there is a previous page |

This `pageInfo` object provides valuable metadata about the pagination of your query results, allowing you to implement efficient navigation and display of large datasets in your application.



## Records in Project

To get a list of records in a project, you can use the following mutation. You can optionally pass a start date and due date to filter the records.

```graphql
query ListOfRecordsWithinProject {
  todoQueries {
    todos(
      filter: { companyIds: ["ENTER COMPANY ID"], projectIds: ["ENTER PROJECT ID"] }
      skip: 20
      limit: 20
      sort: [position_ASC]
    ) {
      items {
        id
        uid
        position
        title
        text
        html
        startedAt
        duedAt
        timezone
        color
        cover
        done
      }
      pageInfo {
        totalPages
        totalItems
        page
        perPage
        hasNextPage
        hasPreviousPage
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Records by User

To get a list of records across all projects that are assigned to a specific user, you can use the following mutation. You can optionally pass a start date and due date to filter the records.

```graphql
query GetAllRecordsAssignedToASpecificUserAcrossAllProjects {
  todoQueries {
    todos(
      filter: {
        companyIds: ["ENTER COMPANY ID"]
        assigneeIds: ["ENTER ASSIGNEE ID"]
      }
      skip: 20
      limit: 20
      sort: [position_ASC]
    ) {
      items {
        id
        uid
        position
        title
        text
        html
        startedAt
        duedAt
        timezone
        color
        cover
        done
      }
      pageInfo {
        totalPages
        totalItems
        page
        perPage
        hasNextPage

      }
    }
  }
}
```
