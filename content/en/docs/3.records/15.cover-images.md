## Overview

Cover images allow you to add visual context to your records by displaying image previews directly on record cards. This feature automatically extracts images from various sources within your records and displays them as thumbnails, making it easier to identify and organize visual content at a glance.

Whether you're managing design projects, content calendars, product catalogs, or any workflow involving visual assets, cover images help you quickly scan through records and find what you're looking for. The feature includes real-time progress tracking and flexible display options to match your specific workflow needs.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Image Extraction**: Blue automatically finds and displays images from your chosen source
- **Multiple Image Sources**: Pull images from record descriptions, comments, or custom file fields
- ** Display Fit Options**: Choose how images appear with Cover or Contain.
- **Smart Selection**: Configure whether to use the first or last image from your source
- **Real-time Updates**: Cover images update automatically when record content changes
- **Live Progress Tracking**: Monitor bulk processing with real-time progress subscriptions

Cover images make your records instantly recognizable

## How It Works

### Enabling Cover Images

Cover images are configured at the project level by Project Administrators:

1. Open your project and navigate to **Project Settings**
2. Select **Record Settings** 
3. Find the **Image Cover Options** section
4. Toggle **Enable Cover Images** to activate the feature

### Configuration Options

#### Image Source
Choose where Blue should look for images:
- **Description**: Extracts images embedded in record descriptions (default)
- **Comments**: Pulls the first/last image from record comments
- **Custom Field**: Uses files from a specific file-type custom field (supports any file type)

#### Image Selection
When multiple images are available, choose which to display:
- **First Image**: Uses the first image found (default)
- **Last Image**: Uses the most recent image

#### Display Fit
Control how images appear in the preview area:
- **Cover**: Image fills the entire preview area, may crop edges to maintain aspect ratio (default)
- **Contain**: Shows the complete image within the preview area, may have empty space

Configure cover images to match your workflow needs

## Use Cases

**Design Projects** - Display mockups and design iterations directly on task cards, making it easy to see the current state of each design task without opening individual records.

**Content Planning** - For content calendars and editorial workflows, show featured images or thumbnails to visualize your content pipeline at a glance.

**Product Management** - Display product photos on inventory records or feature requests, helping teams quickly identify items during discussions.

**Real Estate** - Show property photos on listing records, allowing agents to quickly browse through properties visually.

**Event Planning** - Display venue photos, design concepts, or event layouts on planning tasks for better visual organization.

## Setting Up Cover Images

### Step 1: Choose Your Image Source

Consider where images naturally exist in your workflow:
- If images are part of task descriptions or briefs, use **Description**
- If images are added through team collaboration, use **Comments**
- If you have a dedicated field for images, use **Custom Field**

### Step 2: Configure Display Settings

1. Select your preferred **Image Fit** based on your image types:
   - Use **Cover** for photos and designs where cropping is acceptable
   - Use **Contain** for diagrams or screenshots where you need to see everything

2. Choose **Image Selection** based on your workflow:
   - Use **First** for workflows where the primary image is added initially
   - Use **Last** for workflows where the most recent image is most relevant

### Step 3: Process Existing Records

When you first enable cover images or change configuration, Blue automatically processes your records:
1. Real-time progress updates show processing status 
2. Records are processed in batches (50 records per batch) for optimal performance
3. You can continue working while processing happens in the background
4. Lists will automatically refresh when processing completes
5. Processing automatically triggers when configuration changes are saved
