Reminders in Blue can send you an email or mobile push notification for any records at a predetermined time.  Whether it's replying to an urgent email, submitting a report, or calling a client back, you can schedule reminders so your most pressing responsibilities always get done on time. We handle sending the reminders - you just focus on completing the work.

## Setting a Reminder

To set a reminder on a record:
1. Open the record
2. Click on the clock icon in the top right
3. Select the desired date and time for the reminder

Once you set a reminder, you will see the date and time displayed directly on the record.

## Notification Settings

When the reminder's date and time occurs, you will receive a notification by:
- Email (if enabled in your notification settings)
- Push notification in the Blue web/mobile apps (if enabled)

The notification will alert you to revisit the record.

In your personal notification settings, you can toggle email and push notifications on/off for reminders specifically. This allows you to choose how you want to be notified for reminders.

By default, both options are enabled when reminders are first set up.

## Editing or Deleting Reminders

To edit or remove a reminder:
1. Hover over the date on the record
2. Choose to either edit or delete the reminder

Editing allows you to push the reminder to a later date. Deleting will completely remove the reminder.
