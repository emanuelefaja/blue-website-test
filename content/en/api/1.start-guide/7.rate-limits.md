description: Guidelines for Blue API rate limiting
---

While the Blue API does not enforce hard rate limits, we recommend implementing your own rate limiting for optimal performance and reliability:

1. **Recommended Limit**: Aim to stay within 2,500 requests per minute in production environments.

2. **Self-Implementation**: Implement rate limiting in your application to ensure consistent performance.

3. **Higher Limits**: If you need to handle more requests, please contact us. We may be able to increase your rate limit based on:
   - Your specific use case
   - Your current subscription level

4. **Best Practices**:
   - Use efficient batching when possible to reduce the number of API calls
   - Implement exponential backoff for retries
   - Monitor your API usage to stay within recommended limits

5. **Monitoring**: We continuously monitor API usage and may contact you if we notice unusually high request volumes.

For any questions about rate limits or to discuss increasing your limit, please [contact our support team](mailto:support@blue.cc).
