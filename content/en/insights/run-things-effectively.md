Once you’ve built momentum and gathered a top team, now it is time to run things!

If you are unable to do this in a controlled way, you may end up growing quickly, sometimes even soaring to success, — and then die out even quicker. Unfortunately, this happens to a large percentage of new professional service firms.

To avoid this rapid downfall, you’ll need to ensure that you keep things organized in several areas. Maintaining a good cash flow is essential to keeping your business alive, while learning how to handle projects efficiently will ensure you have good workflows (and relationships) with both your team and your clients. 

Prioritizing simplicity will help you stay sane in the process.
