The Team Members role in Blue provides users more access compared to a basic Client User, while still restricting certain sensitive actions. As the name suggests, it is ideal for actual team members collaborating within a project.

**Permissions**

Team Members can:

- Add other Team Members
- Create new projects
- Make project templates from existing projects
- Have a personal project for task management
- Add, edit, mark complete, and delete most items in a project

**Restrictions**

However, Team Members are limited in that they cannot:

- Delete projects
- Access admin and billing settings
- Upgrade account plan
- Access other user's personal projects
- Delete other user's items

**Use Cases**

The Team Member role empowers actual team members to collaborate while limiting destructive permissions:

- Contributing to shared project work
- Creating and managing their own tasks
- Building new projects using existing templates
- Populating personal task manager
- Commenting and editing most items

**Setup**

To grant the Team Member role:

- Go to People tab in project
- Add team member
- Enter their email and sent invite!
