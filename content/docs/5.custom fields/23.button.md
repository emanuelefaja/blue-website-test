Button custom fields allow you to create buttons that can be used to trigger automation actions in Blue. This is great for creating custom actions, such as sending an email, copying a record, or triggering an automation.

## Creating a Button Custom Field

You can create a button custom field in the same way that you would create any other custom field in your projects.

You can give your button a name and then also choose the type of confirmation. 

## Confirmations

Confirmations are designed to stop accidental button clicks by presenting users with a pop-up to confirm that they do want to press the button.

You have three options for confirmations:

1. **No confirmation** — The automation action is triggered immediately upon button press.
2. **Soft Confirmation** — A confirmation popup is shown, and the user simply has to press the confirm button
3. **Hard Confirmation** — A confirmation popup is shown, and the user has to enter a specific phrase and then press the confirm button

We suggest that hard confirmations are used for buttons that are linked to automation actions which trigger important actions, such as sending a customer a confirmation email. 

## Linking Buttons to Automation Actions

You can select a specific button as an action that can trigger any automation supported in blue.
