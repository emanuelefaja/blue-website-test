title: Time In List

The Time In List custom field automatically tracks how long a record has been in each list, providing detailed insights into workflow progression and bottlenecks.

The Time In List field is extremely valuable for analyzing workflow efficiency and identifying process improvements. Some examples include:

- Monitoring how long support tickets spend in each status (New, In Progress, Waiting for Customer, Resolved)
- Tracking sales pipeline progression to identify where deals get stuck
- Analyzing manufacturing workflow stages to optimize production timelines
- Measuring content approval processes from draft to published
- Identifying bottlenecks in recruitment workflows from application to hire
- Tracking project phases to understand where delays commonly occur
- Monitoring service delivery stages to improve customer experience

The Time In List field provides automatic, real-time tracking without manual intervention. It calculates time spent in each list both historically and currently, showing percentage breakdowns of where records spend the most time. This enables data-driven process optimization, helps identify inefficiencies, and provides clear visibility into workflow performance.

## How It Works

Time In List tracking begins automatically when you add the Time In List custom field to your project. The system:

1. **Tracks Entry and Exit Times**: Records precise timestamps when items enter and leave each list
2. **Calculates Duration**: Automatically computes time spent using the difference between entry and exit times
3. **Handles Current Status**: For items currently in a list, calculates time from entry until now
4. **Preserves History**: Maintains complete time tracking even if lists are renamed or deleted
5. **Shows Percentage Breakdown**: Displays what portion of total time was spent in each list

## Display Options

Time In List data appears in multiple locations:

- **Record Cards**: Shows current list time and total project time with intuitive icons
- **Record Detail View**: Displays comprehensive breakdown with progress bars for each list
- **Database View**: Time data can be displayed in table format for analysis
- **Custom Field Integration**: Works alongside TIME_DURATION custom fields for advanced tracking

## Configuration

The Time In List field requires no configuration - it automatically tracks all list movements. However, you can control display options:

- **Show Time in Current List**: Toggle display of time spent in the current list on record cards
- **Show Time in Project**: Toggle display of total time across all lists in the project
- **Custom Field Visibility**: Control whether time tracking appears in record details

## Key Benefits

- **Zero Setup Required**: Automatically begins tracking when the field is added
- **Complete History**: Maintains tracking even through list changes and deletions
- **Real-Time Updates**: Time calculations update continuously for current items
- **Visual Progress Indicators**: Progress bars show relative time distribution across lists
- **Process Optimization**: Identify where workflows slow down or get stuck
- **Performance Metrics**: Generate insights for team productivity and process efficiency
