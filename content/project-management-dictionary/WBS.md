A **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)** is a project management tool that breaks down a project into smaller, more manageable components. Each component represents a specific deliverable or task that needs to be completed. The WBS is used to organize and define the total scope of the project, making it easier to plan, manage, and track progress. It ensures that all aspects of the project are accounted for and helps in assigning responsibilities, estimating costs, and scheduling tasks effectively.
