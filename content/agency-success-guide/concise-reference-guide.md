## Start Building Momentum

### Chapter 1: The Ideal Scenario.

- Visualize the end-goals for your business. What does success look like?
- Have a sales and marketing strategy to build your client base. Without
traffic, you have nothing.
- Within any strategy, make it a habit to break complex problems into
smaller, actionable steps.

### Chapter 2: Be Wildly Different.
- Focus on standing out from the crowd.
- Devise and execute a long-term strategy, but remember that it’s a
constantly evolving and ongoing process.
- Seek 1% improvements every day to see meaningful change over time.

### Chapter 3: Writing Winning Proposals.

- Perfect your proposal writing.
- Use proposals to give clarity to the client about their project, and
convey why your firm is their best choice.
- Avoid copy-paste solutions and content — show that you obsess over
detail.

## Working With Humans.

### Chapter 4: Nurturing Top Talent.
- Consider the non-negotiable qualities you’re looking for when qualifying potential team members.
- Build a diverse, cross-functional team to get the most innovative ideas.
- Remember that you are working with humans, and it’s not just your
company – it’s everyone’s company.

### Chapter 5: Delegation is Entrepreneurship.
- Delegation is one of your best weapons. Know when to delegate responsibilities to your team.
- Find the point of constraint and direct most of your efforts toward working on it. Manage your time by prioritizing.
- Consider which of the five mental hats to “wear” in different cases.

### Chapter 6: Qualify Your Clients.
- Qualifying clients is equally as important as qualifying team members.
- Pay attention to projects that will benefit you and build strong
relationships.
- Seek clients that you genuinely like; people that you connect and
share values with.

## Run Things Effectively.

### Chapter 7: Cash is King.
- Ensure that there is always enough cash in the bank (at least 6 months’ reserve). You need to cover all essential costs, and they add up.
- Choose the right engagement model for your business and try to retain regular clients. Bill fixed projects on a monthly basis.
- Keep your work quality and your finances healthy.

### Chapter 8: Keep It Simple.
- Embrace simplicity – simple sells!
- Keep your team lean and agile. Smaller organizations are more
efficient, flexible, and sustainable than large organizations.
- Define what is truly important to your business and obsessively focus
on those things.

### Chapter 9: Effective Project Management.

- Have a clear process to enable you to complete the work at hand.
- Break down projects into actionable steps. Have a system to manage
projects (you could try Blue).
- Maintain clear and transparent communication. Track client feedback
and keep meeting minutes.

Thank you for coming along on this journey — I hope you’ve enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed writing this book. Now, go out into the world, put everything you’ve learned into practice, and, most importantly, have fun!
