                                During our team meeting today, we discussed the Q4 product roadmap extensively. Sarah mentioned that the mobile app redesign is behind schedule due to unexpected technical challenges with the new authentication system. The iOS team needs an additional two weeks to implement biometric login properly. Meanwhile, the Android team is on track but waiting for the iOS implementation to maintain feature parity.

                                John from marketing emphasized the importance of launching before Black Friday to capitalize on holiday shopping. He suggested we could do a soft launch with basic features and add biometric login in a subsequent update. The engineering team expressed concerns about rushing the release, citing potential security vulnerabilities. After much debate, we need to make a decision by end of week.
