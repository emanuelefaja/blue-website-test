                    "question": "How does the table of contents work?",
                    "answer": "Wiki pages automatically generate a table of contents based on headings in your content. Headings formatted with # markdown syntax are detected and organized into a navigable outline. Click any heading to jump to that section, and the table updates dynamically as you edit."
