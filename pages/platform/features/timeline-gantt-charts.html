                    "answer": "Blue's timeline is built for real-time collaboration with drag-and-drop simplicity. Unlike traditional Gantt software, you can reschedule tasks by dragging, switch between 5 zoom levels with keyboard shortcuts, and see updates from your team instantly. It's designed for modern teams who need flexibility, not rigid project plans."

                    "question": "Can I see dependencies between tasks?",
                    "answer": "Yes! Dependencies are shown as visual lines connecting related tasks. Set up 'blocking' relationships to show which tasks must complete before others can start. The timeline automatically displays these connections, helping you identify critical paths and potential bottlenecks in your project schedule."

Switch instantly using keyboard shortcuts (D, W, M, Q, Y) or navigation buttons. Each view optimizes the display for that time scale, from detailed daily planning to high-level annual roadmaps."

                    "question": "Can I group the timeline by different criteria?",
                    "answer": "Yes! Group your timeline by Lists (to see project phases), Assignees (to view team workloads), or Tags (to track work streams). Switch groupings anytime to get different perspectives on your project. This flexibility helps with resource planning, workload balancing, and tracking parallel initiatives."

                    "question": "How do I reschedule tasks in the timeline?",
                    "answer": "Simply drag any task horizontally to move it to a new date. Drag the edges of a task to extend or shorten its duration. You can also drag tasks vertically to move them between lists, assignees, or tags (depending on your grouping). All changes save automatically and update for your team in real-time."

                    "question": "Does the timeline update in real-time?",
                    "answer": "Yes! When team members make changes - moving tasks, updating dates, or adding dependencies - you see those updates immediately on your timeline. There's no need to refresh or sync. This real-time collaboration ensures everyone always sees the current project status."

                    "answer": "Absolutely! Group by assignees to see each team member's workload over time. Easily identify who's overloaded and who has capacity. Drag tasks between team members to balance workloads. The visual timeline makes resource conflicts obvious before they become problems."

                    "answer": "The timeline extends infinitely - plan as far into the future as needed. Whether you're planning next week's sprint or next year's roadmap, the timeline scales to your needs. Use the zoom controls to switch between detailed short-term and strategic long-term views."

                    "question": "Can I track project milestones on the timeline?",
                    "answer": "Yes! Create milestone tasks with specific dates and they'll appear as distinct markers on your timeline. Use dependencies to link tasks to milestones, showing what needs to complete for each milestone. The visual timeline makes it easy to see if you're on track to hit key dates."
                },

                    "answer": "Yes! Switch seamlessly between Timeline, Kanban, Calendar, Database, and other views. Your filters, task data, and organization persist across all views. Use Timeline for scheduling, then switch to Kanban for workflow management or Calendar for date-focused planning - all with the same data."
