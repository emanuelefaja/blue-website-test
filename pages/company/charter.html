                    We build tools that democratize access to sophisticated work management capabilities, ensuring that every team—regardless of size, budget, or technical expertise—can benefit from better organization and collaboration.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p class="text-lg mb-8">To that end, we commit to the following principles:</p>

            <!-- Customer-First Independence -->
            <section class="mb-12">
                <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 mb-6">Customer-First Independence</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    We commit to maintaining complete independence from investor pressures that might compromise our commitment to customer success, affordability, or long-term thinking. Our primary obligation is to our customers and their success.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    As a self-funded company, we make decisions based on what customers actually need, not what maximizes quarterly returns or satisfies external stakeholders. Every feature, pricing decision, and strategic choice will be evaluated through the lens of customer benefit.
                </p>
                <div class="bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
                    <strong>Our commitment:</strong> We will never compromise customer success for investor returns because we don't have investors to appease.
                </div>
            </section>

            <!-- Democratized Access -->
            <section class="mb-12">
                <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 mb-6">Democratized Access</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    We commit to ensuring that powerful work organization tools remain accessible to all teams, not just well-funded enterprises. We will resist the industry trend toward increasingly complex and expensive solutions that exclude smaller organizations.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Enterprise-grade capabilities should not require enterprise budgets. We believe that a 5-person startup deserves the same sophisticated process management tools as a 5,000-person corporation.
                </p>
                <div class="bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
                    <strong>Our commitment:</strong> At $7 per user per month, we provide 80% of enterprise functionality at 20% of the cost, ensuring growing teams can access world-class process management without breaking their budgets.
                </div>

            <!-- Sustainable Simplicity -->

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibent text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 mb-6">Sustainable Simplicity</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    We are committed to building solutions that are "as simple as they should be, but no simpler." We will actively resist feature bloat and complexity that serves no genuine customer need.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    We recognize that in a world of unlimited venture capital funding, there is competitive pressure to over-engineer solutions. We commit to disciplined product development—every feature must clear an extremely high bar of solving real customer problems before implementation.
                </p>
                <div class="bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
                    <strong>Our commitment:</strong> We do less, but better—resulting in faster onboarding, less training overhead, and higher adoption rates than bloated alternatives.

                <p class="mb-4">
                    To remain effective at democratizing work organization, Blue must deliver exceptional value while maintaining our core principles of simplicity and affordability across decades, not quarters.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    We believe that sustainable business practices and customer obsession create better long-term outcomes than growth-at-all-costs mentalities. We will prioritize craftsmanship, reliability, and deep customer relationships over market share or valuation metrics.
                </p>
                <div class="bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
                    <strong>Our commitment:</strong> We build for the long term, making decisions that benefit customers for decades rather than satisfying short-term pressures.

            <!-- Process Individualism -->

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 mb-6">Process Individualism</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    We reject the notion that all organizations should follow the same "best practices." True competitive advantage comes from doing things differently, not from copying what everyone else does.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    While the industry pushes standardized workflows and generic templates, we believe organizations should differentiate themselves through their unique business processes. Your competitive edge shouldn't be sacrificed for the convenience of one-size-fits-all software.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Blue adapts to your thinking, not the other way around. We provide the foundation for you to build processes that reflect your organization's unique strengths, culture, and strategic advantages.
                </p>
                <div class="bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
                    <strong>Our commitment:</strong> We will never force you into generic "best practices." Your processes should be as unique as your business—and that's exactly what creates lasting competitive advantage.
