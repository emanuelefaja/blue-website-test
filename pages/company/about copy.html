            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-900 mb-4">Our Mission</h3>
            <p class="text-lg text-blue-800 font-medium">
                Blue's mission is to organize the world's work by building the best project management platform on the planet—simple, powerful, flexible, and affordable for all.
            </p>
            <p class="text-blue-700 mt-4">
                We build tools that democratize access to sophisticated work management capabilities, ensuring that every team—regardless of size, budget, or technical expertise—can benefit from better organization and collaboration.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p class="text-lg mb-8">To that end, we commit to the following principles:</p>

        <!-- Democratized Access -->
        <section class="mb-12">
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-6">Democratized Access</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                We commit to ensuring that powerful work organization tools remain accessible to all teams, not just well-funded enterprises. We will resist the industry trend toward increasingly complex and expensive solutions that exclude smaller organizations.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Our primary obligation is to our customers and their success. As a self-funded company, we maintain complete independence from investor pressures that might compromise our commitment to affordability, simplicity, or long-term thinking. Every decision will be evaluated through the lens of customer benefit.
            </p>
            <div class="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg">
                <strong>At $7 per user per month</strong>, we provide 80% of enterprise functionality at 20% of the cost of our competitors, ensuring that growing teams can access world-class project management without breaking their budgets.
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- Sustainable Simplicity -->
        <section class="mb-12">
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-6">Sustainable Simplicity</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                We are committed to building solutions that are "as simple as they should be, but no simpler." We will actively resist feature bloat and complexity that serves no genuine customer need.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                We recognize that in a world of unlimited venture capital funding, there is competitive pressure to over-engineer solutions. We commit to disciplined product development—every feature must clear an extremely high bar of solving real customer problems before implementation.
            </p>
            <div class="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg">
                <strong>Our advantage</strong> is that we do not have hundreds of engineers building features for the sake of building features. We do less, but better—resulting in faster onboarding, less training overhead, and higher adoption rates.
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- Customer-Centric Excellence -->
        <section class="mb-12">
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-6">Customer-Centric Excellence</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                To remain effective at democratizing work organization, Blue must deliver exceptional value while maintaining our core principles of simplicity and affordability.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                We believe that sustainable business practices and customer obsession create better long-term outcomes than growth-at-all-costs mentalities. We will prioritize craftsmanship, reliability, and deep customer relationships over market share or valuation metrics.
            </p>
            <div class="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg">
                <strong>Our self-funded model</strong> ensures we can make decisions based on customer needs and long-term thinking rather than external pressures or short-term financial goals.

        <!-- Collaborative Philosophy -->
        <section class="mb-12">
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-6">Collaborative Philosophy</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                We will actively support the broader ecosystem of work management tools and practices. We seek to elevate industry standards around simplicity, transparency, and customer focus.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                We are committed to sharing knowledge that helps teams work better together. This includes our documentation, best practices, and insights about effective team collaboration—because when teams everywhere work better, everyone benefits.
            </p>
            <div class="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg">
                <strong>Our platform</strong> adapts to your unique processes rather than forcing you to change how you work. We believe organizations should differentiate themselves through their unique business processes, not by following generic "best practices."
